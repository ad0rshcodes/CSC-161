Monday's Lab:

D3) 
    We added "printf("test"); string_list_print(lst);" at the end of the destroy function and we can see the string "test" being printed but nothing gets printed from string_list_print function. Therefore, we can conclude there's nothing left to print in the lst. 

E2)
    ./list-practice-asan
    Enter a command. Type "help" to see available options.
    > insert adarsh 
    > insert anshul
    > append csc161
    > print
    anshul 
    adarsh 
    csc161 


Wednesday's Lab:

B3) 
    string_list_insert:

        When a string is inserted, the list’s length should be incremented by 1.
        After inserting a new node, increase lst->length.

    string_list_remove:

        When a string is removed, the list’s length should be decremented by 1.
        After removing a node, decrease lst->length.

    string_list_destroy:

        The list's length should be set to 0 when the list is destroyed.
        Set lst->length to 0 after freeing the nodes.
