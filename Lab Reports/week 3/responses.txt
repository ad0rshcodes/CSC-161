Lab: Functions 

B.  Refer to the c files.

C. 
    1. Predicted Output: 
    
       The total is 208 
       The total is 208
       The total is 218

       The first print statement is calling upon sum() which will add all the elements of array values. 

       The incrementValue() is called inside the loop, but it increments the local copy of each values[i] (since v is passed by value). Therefore, second print statement remains same as first. 

       The incrementArray() function correctly increments each element in the values array (since arrays are passed by reference). Therefore, each element is increased by 1 and the print statement prints 218. 

    2. Refer to the c files.

    3. Our predictions correctly matched the output. 

    4. If the length is smaller than the actual length, sum() will calculate the sum of initial number of elements you passed.

    If its larger than the array length, it won't throw any error and add whatever is stored in that memory location even when its supposed to be out of bound. 
    It will result in a garbage value.
