Lab Report Week 4

Group: Finn, Adarsh

Acknowledgement: Our course mentor Chloe assisted us in Wednesday's lab to
better understand binary representations.

Monday A.1-2, B.1, B.3

See quadratic.c and the bottom of reduce.c.

Wednesday A.4, A.5, B.1-3

For A: See integer-rep.c

B1: The maximum integer would be 2^14 + 2^13 + 2^12 + ... 2^1 + 2^0.

B2: The maximum integer would be 2^30 + 2^29 + 2^28 + ..... 2^1 + 2^0.

B3: Essentially, these companies didn't account for overflow. They only had
a certain amount of memory allocated for views/charges for a specific
thing. Issues arose when memory past these integer limits were attempted to
be "accessed".

Friday A.3, A.4, B.3

See data-rep.c.

See float-loop.c.
