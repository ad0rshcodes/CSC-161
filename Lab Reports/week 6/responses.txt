C1.

   The addresses of side1 are equal for both perimeter and area. Same with
   side2. They are also the same as length (side1) and width (side2)


C2.   length and width will be adjacent
   perimeter and area will be adjacent

C3.    we were right about the shared location of side1 in perimiter and side 1
   in area, as well as side2. We were not right about length and width being
   the same as side1/side2

   we were right about adjacent addresses as well

D2. Prediction: Perimeter and length are the same. Width and area are the same. 

Result: non of them are the same or adjacent
