1 & 2.
  char *baboon; // Valid because it's a pointer declaration
  char *chimpanzee = "animal"; // Valid because it's a string literal
  char dolphin[]; // Invalid because it does not specify size of the array
  char emu[] = "animal";  // Valid character array initialization -
  automatically gets size
  char giraffe[8] = "animal"; // Valid character array initialization -
  fixed size
  char fox[4] = "animal"; // Valid, but may cause error due to shorter size
  char elephant[10]; // Valid character array declaration - fixed sie
  elephant = "animal"; // Invalid because its not assignable

3. Giraffe would spill over into fox. It will take extra
characters that haven't been assigned because "animal" is greater than 4
characters, meaning it will end i 'm' instead of \0.
Since it doesn't have a \0, fox keeps reading characters and moves into the
neighboring array memory (giraffe).

D. Done

A2. Atoi is used to convert a ASCII string (that is intended to be an integer) to an integer.
    strtod is used to convert a ASCII string to a float.
