A.
        2. 'p' is a pointer to a NULL pointer. 'q' is pointing to x whose
        value is 200.
        3. 
           int* p;
           int* q = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
           int* temp = q;
           if (q == NULL) {
              perror("Failed to allocate memory");
              exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           int x = 5;
           p = &x;
           *q = 100;
           *p = 200;
           p = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
           if (p == NULL) {
              perror("Failed to allocate memory");
              exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }

           q = &x;


C.         
           1.It is important to free allocated memory because it makes the
           program more efficient and saves space in the heap. A program that exceeds the heap memory.
