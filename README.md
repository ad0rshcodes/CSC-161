# [CSC-161 Imperative Problem Solving (Nicole Eikmeier)]([url](https://eikmeier.sites.grinnell.edu/csc-161-fall-2024/))

CSC-161 is one of the core courses for CS major at Grinnell College. This class uses the C programming language, a classic and influential example of an imperative language still in widespread use today. Imperative programming languages, and C in particular, sit quite close to the hardware that runs the programs we write; as a result, solving problems in C requires us to think carefully about the structure of our computation solutions and the resources we use. The reward for this extra effort is that C programs can be extremely fast, and can run on practically any computing device. Building your imperative problem-solving skills in C will prepare you for CSC 207: Object-Oriented Problem Solving, Data Structures, and Algorithms. You’ll also be prepared to pick up many of the C-inspired languages on your own, and of course, you’ll be better at developing computational solutions that mix approaches from both functional and imperative styles.
